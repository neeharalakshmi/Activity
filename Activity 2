1.) Using “man command” can you provide me the explanations of the output for the 
following commands:
tree -a, tree -d, tree -u, …., tree -p.

Ans: 
tree -a
Explanation:
The tree -a command displays all files and directories, including hidden ones (those starting with a dot). This shows the complete directory structure.

tree -d
Explanation:
The tree -d command displays only directories, excluding all files. This is useful for viewing the folder structure without file clutter.

tree -u
Explanation:
The tree -u command displays the username (or UID if no name is available) of the file/directory owner in the output.

tree -g
Explanation:
The tree -g command displays the group name (or GID if no name is available) of the file/directory owner.

tree -p
Explanation:
The tree -p command displays the file permissions for each file and directory in the traditional Unix format (e.g., -rw-r--r--).

• ifconfig
• ping
• traceroute
